## Plugins

As you craft your vim environment, one of the most powerful features
will be taking advantage of existing plugins. There are a couple plugin
management systems that exist (pathogen and [vundle][vundle] are the most
common). I've tried both pathogen and [vundle][vundle] and you **must** use
[vundle][vundle].

Using vundle makes adding and instlaling plugins to use with vim much
like adding gems to a `Gemfile`.

Follow [these instructions][vundle-quick-start] and get vundle installed
and running with your `.vimrc`.
